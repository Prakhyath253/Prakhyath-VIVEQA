# Sentinel-RV: Code Directory Specification

Welcome to the **`Codes/`** directory of the **Sentinel-RV Capstone Project**. This directory contains all hardware design modules and software applications needed to synthesize, program and run the secure RISC-V System-on-Chip.

The codebase is organized into two distinct sections:

* ⚡ **[`Verilog/`](Verilog/)**: Hardware description code, testbenches, XDC constraints and Vivado project files.
* 🐍 **[`Python/`](Python/)**: Desktop control center applications, real-time sensor graphing tools and SD card reader utilities.
