# Sentinel-RV Capstone Project: RISC-V Hardware Security & Telemetry System

Welcome to the **Sentinel-RV Capstone Project** repository. This project implements a secure, FPGA-based System-on-Chip (SoC) powered by an open-source 32-bit RISC-V processor (`PicoRV32`), hardware-accelerated AES-128 encryption, anti-replay security controllers, multi-sensor telemetry collection and desktop GUI monitoring applications.

## ⚡ Key Features & Hardware Capabilities

1. **32-Bit RISC-V CPU Core (`PicoRV32`):** Executes embedded firmware instructions to manage memory-mapped I/O peripherals and process security policies.
2. **Hardware AES-128 Encryption Engine (`aes128_encrypt.v`):** Encrypts sensor data streams and Micro-SD audit logs in hardware.
3. **Anti-Replay Security Controller (`replay_protection.v` & `nonce_generator.v`):** Generates 64-bit dynamic nonces to reject replayed unauthorized commands.
4. **Environmental & Intrusion Telemetry:** Interfaced with DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity), HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic Distance), MCP3202 (12-bit SPI ADC) and internal Artix-7 XADC (die temperature & voltage rails).
5. **SPI Micro-SD Audit Logger (`sd_logger.v`):** Writes encrypted, tamper-evident security audit logs directly to physical SD card sectors.
6. **Local User Interface & Safety Isolation:** Keypad (4x4 matrix input), 16x2 LCD display, 4-digit 7-segment display, piezo alarm siren and relay power isolation switches.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Opening the Project in Xilinx Vivado
1. Launch Xilinx Vivado (Version 2025.2 or compatible).
2. Open the project file located at:  
   `Sentinel_RV_Capstone_Project/Codes/Verilog/Sentinel_RV-Project/Sentinel_RV-Project.xpr`
3. Click **Run Synthesis** or **Run Implementation** to generate the FPGA bitstream for the Artix-7 target (`xc7a35tftg256-1`).

### 2. Running the Python Desktop Application
1. Connect the Artix-7 FPGA board to your PC via USB-UART serial connection.
2. Navigate to `Sentinel_RV_Capstone_Project/Codes/Python/`.
3. Launch the control application:
   ```bash
   python App1_FPGA_Control_And_Sensors.py
   ```
4. Select the active COM port and baud rate (`115200`) to view live real-time sensor graphs and control the system.
